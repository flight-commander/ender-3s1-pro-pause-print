Putting on github since admin had asked poster to take it down. 

It worked perfectly - will try again.. only issue was maybe too much filament comes out on the purge - Maybe a tad slower on the purge and not so much.. 

 

Going to give it a go again - apparently you have back out and on the touch screen and then play button resumes. Finally got the play button back with this new script.. this is great thanks.

 Oh and had to change (Pause Command to M25BQ )- this is what brought the play button back.
